# Postmodernes Design/Meine Notizen

## The line between Copy-paste and Innovation

Copy-paste:  

- Products generally of poorer Quality 
- cheaper, due to worse quality of materials used and saved R&amp;D-cost
- intent to decieve  

Transforming/Innovation:
<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004 -->
- Take base concepts of the Source, but Transform to Match current use-case
  * Example: Apple (Desktop-パソコン; *left*) <-> BrAun (FM-Radio; *right*)

### When are we Ok with it?

Generally Accepted  | Generally frowned upon
--------------------|-----------------------
**Transformative Work**, Where the source is more of an Inspiration. | **Knock-offs** with less Quality to save expenses  
**Tributes** | **Fraud**
**Copy-pasting¹⁺²** ||
**Cobination** and **Remixes**

¹ : only if the source model was out for a long time  
² : for Learning purposes (Copying previous work to get "a feel" for it)
